{"name":"Afsportland2015","tagline":"Materials for the \"Age and Growth Analyses with R\" CE course at AFS meeting in Portland","body":"# Course Description\r\nThis one-day course is for fisheries professionals and students interested in expanding their R skills to include analysis of age and growth data.  Through a sequence of demonstrations and hands-on application exercises, participants will use R to construct appropriate metrics and graphics for comparing precision (APE, ACV) and bias (age agreement table, tests of symmetry, and age-bias plots) between two sets of estimated ages, construct and apply an age-length key to estimate ages of individual fish from their lengths, summarize mean length-at-age with a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), and statistically compare VBGF parameters between two or more groups of fish.  Participants should be familiar with the fundamentals of R, including basic applications.\r\n\r\n# Pre-Course Preparation\r\n* Install the latest version of R (v3.2.1) on your laptop.  [Directions for a first install are here](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Course_Prep/InstallR.pdf).  If you are using Windows and already have R installed, then [an easy method to upgrade is described here](http://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/\").\r\n* I prefer to use RStudio to interact with R (but RStudio is not required for this course).  [Directions to install and prepare RStudio are here](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Course_Prep/InstallRStudio.pdf) (along with a quick introduction to the RStudio interface).\r\n* Install several packages for use in the course.  Directions for installing these packages are [here if you plan to use RStudio](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Course_Prep/InstallPackages_RStudio.pdf) and [here if you plan to use R directly](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Course_Prep/InstallPackages_R.pdf).\r\n* Use the forthcoming Introduction to Fisheries Analysis with R book to (re)familiarize yourself with R basics (Chapters [1](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/xxxDraftChaps4Web/RBasics_IntroFishAnalysisR.pdf), [2](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/xxxDraftChaps4Web/Plotting_IntroFishAnalysisR.pdf), and [3](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/xxxDraftChaps4Web/DataManip_IntroFishAnalysisR.pdf)) and the age and growth (Chapters [4](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/xxxDraftChaps4Web/AgeComparisons_IntroFishAnalysisR.pdf), [5](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/xxxDraftChaps4Web/AgeLengthKey_IntroFishAnalysisR.pdf), and [12](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/xxxDraftChaps4Web/Growth_IntroFishAnalysisR.pdf)) topics of the course.\r\n* Finally, from the course materials below, print all R Handouts(for taking notes on) and download all [slides](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/tree/master/Slides) and handout [scripts](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/tree/master/Scripts) to bring to the course.\r\n\r\n# Course Materials\r\n1. **Precision and Bias**\r\n    * [Slides](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Slides/01_AgeComparisons.pptx) // [Handout](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/01_AgeComparisons.pdf) // [Script](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Scripts/01_AgeComparisons.R) // [Assignment](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/4Exercises/xxxDrafts4Web/AgeComparisons_IntroFishAnalysisR_Ex.pdf)\r\n\r\n2. **Age-Length Key -- Construction**\r\n    * [Slides](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Slides/02_AgeLengthKey.pptx) // [Handout](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/02_ALKConstruction.pdf) // [Script](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Scripts/02_ALKConstruction.R) // [Assignment](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/4Exercises/xxxDrafts4Web/AgeLengthKey_IntroFishAnalysisR_Ex.pdf)\r\n\r\n3. **Age-Length Key -- Application**\r\n    * [Handout](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/03_ALKApplication.pdf) // [Script](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Scripts/03_ALKApplication.R)\r\n\r\n4. **Growth -- Fit von Bertalanffy Growth Function**\r\n    * [Slides](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Slides/04_Growth.pptx) // [Handout](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/04_GrowthFitting.pdf) // [Script](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Scripts/04_GrowthFitting.R) // [Assignment](https://github.com/droglenc/IFAR/raw/master/4Exercises/xxxDrafts4Web/Growth_IntroFishAnalysisR_Ex.pdf)\r\n\r\n5. **Growth -- Compare von Bertalanffy Growth Functions**\r\n    * [Slides](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Slides/05_Growth_Comparison.pptx) // [Handout](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/05_GrowthComparisons.pdf) // [Script](https://github.com/droglenc/AFSPortland2015/raw/master/Scripts/05_GrowthComparisons.R)\r\n\r\n# Follow-Up\r\n* Please complete this survey regarding this short course.\r\n* If you have any questions please feel free [to contact me](mailto:dogle@northland.edu)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
